A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.},

We notice that some RRd stars in the Galactic bulge show unusually short

days and P1O/PF≍0.726. In the Petersen
diagram double-mode RRLyr stars form a parabola-like structure, which
connects shorter- and longer-period RRd stars. We show that the unique
properties of the bulge RRd stars may be explained by allowing for the
wide range of the metal abundance extending up to [Fe/H]≍-0.36.

We report the discovery of an RR Lyr star with additional eclipsing
variability with the orbital period of 15.2447 days. Some statistical

We discuss some statistical features of the sample. Period distributions
show distinct differences between SMC and LMC populations of RR Lyr
variable stars, with the SMC stars having on average longer periods. The
mean periods for RRab, RRc and RRe stars are 0.596, 0.366 and 0.293
days, respectively. The mean apparent magnitudes of RRab stars are equal
to 19.70 mag in the V-band and 19.12 mag in the I-band. Spatial
distribution of RRLyr stars shows that the halo of the SMC is roughly
round in the sky, however the density map reveals two maxima near the

classified as peculiar W Vir stars - a recently identified subclass of

brighter and bluer than the ordinary W Vir variables. We confirm that a
large fraction of the peculiar W Vir stars are members of binary

Three type II Cepheids exhibit eclipsing variations superimposed on the

ellipsoidal variability. All stars with the indication of binarity
display secondary periods which may be interpreted as amplitude and/or
phase modulations of the pulsation light curves with periods equal to
the orbital periods or half the orbital periods. We do not have any
model for these modulations, however this phenomenon rules out a
possibility of the optical blends of a pulsating star and a binary

secondary variations with periods in the range 0.60-0.65 of the primary
ones. These stars populate three distinct sequences in the Petersen
diagram. The origin of this secondary modulation is still unknown.
Contrary to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) we found only a few
candidates for anomalous Cepheids in the SMC. This fact may be a clue
for the explanation of the origin of the anomalous Cepheids. The period
and luminosity distributions of Cepheids in both Magellanic Clouds
suggest that there are two or three populations of classical Cepheids in
each of the galaxies. The main difference between the LMC and SMC lays
in different numbers of Cepheids in each group. We fit the

pulsators. 66 objects are foreground Galactic RR Lyr stars. The catalog
data include basic photometric and astrometric properties of these RR
Lyr stars, multi-epoch VI photometry and finding charts.We
detected one new RR Lyr star with additional eclipsing variations. The
spatial distribution of RR Lyr stars in the LMC is distinctly
non-spherical and it is elongated in the same direction as the LMC bar.
The basic statistical features of RR Lyr stars in the LMC are provided.
The apparent V-band magnitudes for RRab stars have the modal value at
19.36 mag, and for overtone RR Lyr stars it is about 19.32 mag. The mean
periods for RRab, RRc and RRe stars are 0.576, 0.337 and 0.270 days,
respectively.},

	abstract = {In the second part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS) 
we present 197 type II Cepheids and 83 anomalous Cepheids in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The sample of type II Cepheids consists of 64 BL
Her stars, 96 W Vir stars and 37 RV Tau stars. Anomalous Cepheids are
divided into 62 fundamental-mode and 21 first-overtone pulsators. These
are the largest samples of such types of variable stars detected
anywhere outside the Galaxy.

We present the period-luminosity and color-magnitude diagrams of stars
in the sample. If the boundary period between BL Her and W Vir stars is
adopted at 4 days, both groups differ significantly in (V-I) colors. We
identify a group of 16 peculiar W Vir stars with different appearance of
the light curves, brighter and bluer than ordinary stars of that type.
Four of these peculiar W Vir stars show additional eclipsing modulation
superimposed on the pulsation light curves. Four other stars of that
type show long-period secondary variations which may be ellipsoidal
modulations. It suggests that peculiar W Vir subgroup may be related to
binarity. In total, we identified seven type II Cepheids simultaneously
exhibiting eclipsing variations which is a very large fraction compared
to classical Cepheids in the LMC. We discuss diagrams showing Fourier
parameters of the light curve decomposition against periods. Three sharp
features interpreted as an effect of resonances between radial modes are
detectable in these diagrams for type II Cepheids.},

compiled from the data collected in the course of the third phase of the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III). In this paper we
describe the catalog of 3361 classical Cepheids detected in the approx
40 square degrees area in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The sample
consists of 1848 fundamental-mode (F), 1228 first-overtone (1O), 14
second-overtone (2O), 61 double-mode F/1O, 203 double-mode 1O/2O, 2
double-mode 1O/3O, and 5 triple-mode classical Cepheids. This sample is
supplemented by the list of 23 ultra-low amplitude variable stars which
may be Cepheids entering or exiting instability strip.

The catalog data include VI high-quality photometry collected since
2001, and for some stars supplemented by the OGLE-II photometry obtained
between 1997 and 2000. We provide basic parameters of the stars:
coordinates, periods, mean magnitudes, amplitudes and parameters of the
Fourier light curve decompositions. Our sample of Cepheids is
cross-identified with previously published catalogs of these variables
in the LMC. Individual objects of particular interest are discussed,
including single-mode second-overtone Cepheids, multiperiodic pulsators
with unusual period ratios or Cepheids in eclipsing binary systems.

We discuss the variations of the Fourier coefficients with periods and
point out on the sharp feature for periods around 0.35 days of
first-overtone Cepheids, which can be explained by the occurrence of 2:1
resonance between the first and fifth overtones. Similar behavior at P
approx 3 days for 1O Cepheids and P approx 10 days for F Cepheids are
also interpreted as an effect of resonances between two radial modes. We
fit the period-luminosity relations to our sample of Cepheids and
compare these functions with previous determinations.},

	abstract = {With the coming data deluge from synoptic surveys, there is a need for frameworks that can quickly and automatically produce calibrated classification probabilities for newly observed variables based on small numbers of time-series measurements. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for variable-star classification, drawing from modern machine-learning techniques. We describe how to homogenize the information gleaned from light curves by selection and computation of real-numbered metrics (features), detail methods to robustly estimate periodic features, introduce tree-ensemble methods for accurate variable-star classification, and show how to rigorously evaluate a classifier using cross validation. On a 25-class data set of 1542 well-studied variable stars, we achieve a 22.8\% error rate using the random forest (RF) classifier; this represents a 24\% improvement over the best previous classifier on these data. This methodology is effective for identifying samples of specific science classes: for pulsational variables used in Milky Way tomography we obtain a discovery efficiency of 98.2\% and for eclipsing systems we find an efficiency of 99.1\%, both at 95\% purity. The RF classifier is superior to other methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and relative immunity to irrelevant features; the RF can also be used to estimate the importance of each feature in classification. Additionally, we present the first astronomical use of hierarchical classification methods to incorporate a known class taxonomy in the classifier, which reduces the catastrophic error rate from 8\% to 7.8\%. Excluding low-amplitude sources, the overall error rate improves to 14\%, with a catastrophic error rate of 3.5\%.},

	abstract = {L-moments are expectations of certain linear combinations of order statistics. They can be defined for any random variable whose mean exists and form the basis of a general theory which covers the summarization and description of theoretical probability distributions, the summarization and description of observed data samples, estimation of parameters and quantiles of probability distributions, and hypothesis tests for probability distributions. The theory involves such established procedures as the use of order statistics and Gini's mean difference statistic, and gives rise to some promising innovations such as the measures of skewness and kurtosis described in Section 2, and new methods of parameter estimation for several distributions. The theory of L-moments parallels the theory of (conventional) moments, as this list of applications might suggest. The main advantage of L-moments over conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear functions of the data, suffer less from the effects of sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than conventional moments to outliers in the data and enable more secure inferences to be made from small samples about an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes yield more efficient parameter estimates than the maximum likelihood estimates.},

	abstract = {We derive an asymptotic expansion for the excess risk (regret) of a weighted nearest-neighbour classifier. This allows us to find the asymptotically optimal vector of nonnegative weights, which has a rather simple form. We show that the ratio of the regret of this classifier to that of an unweighted kk-nearest neighbour classifier depends asymptotically only on the dimension dd of the feature vectors, and not on the underlying populations. The improvement is greatest when d=4d=4, but thereafter decreases as d→∞d{\textbackslash}rightarrow{\textbackslash}infty. The popular bagged nearest neighbour classifier can also be regarded as a weighted nearest neighbour classifier, and we show that its corresponding weights are somewhat suboptimal when dd is small (in particular, worse than those of the unweighted kk-nearest neighbour classifier when d=1d=1), but are close to optimal when dd is large. Finally, we argue that improvements in the rate of convergence are possible under stronger smoothness assumptions, provided we allow negative weights. Our findings are supported by an empirical performance comparison on both simulated and real data sets.},
